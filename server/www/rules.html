        <h1>Cerealbar 2 Rules.</h1>
        <p>This game is a research project to study human-human interaction and natural language processing (NLP). It is a followup to <a href="https://lil.nlp.cornell.edu/cerealbar/">this study.</a></p>
        <h2>Game Objective</h2>
        <p>The goal of the game is to collect as many unique sets of 3 cards as
        possible. Note: this isn't a competition!! The follower and the
        leader work together.</p>
        <h2>Unique Sets</h2>
        <img src="/images/question-1-option-d.png" width="100px" height="100px" alt="image-of-card" />
        <img src="/images/question-2-option-b.png" width="100px" height="100px" alt="image-of-card" />
        <img src="/images/question-2-option-c.png" width="100px" height="100px" alt="image-of-card" />
        <p>Each card has a color, a shape, and a number (1-3) of occurences of
        that shape. A unique set is one in which each card is unique in all 3
        attributes. When a unique set is collected, the 3 cards disappear from
        the board and are replaced with 3 new cards.</p> 
        <h2>Game Over</h2>
        <p>The game is over when the number of turns runs out.</p>
        <h2>The Leader's Turn</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>The leader can see the entire board. Plan ahead and give instructions
        to the follower to collect sets.</li>
        <li>The leader gets <b>a minute per turn</b>. The leader's turn ends when time
        runs out (But the leader can also end the turn early). If the leader has
        not left any instructions for the follower, the follower's turn will be
        skipped -- it will be the leader's turn again, and the # of turns
        remaining will decrease by 1.</li>
        <li>If the follower doesn't understand, please be
        patient and try again.
        Remember that there are all sorts of people out there. Each game is
        between two humans -- there's someone else out there working with
        you!</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>The Follower's Turn</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>The follower's role is simpler. Your strength is additional mobility.</li>
        <li>Without any instructions from the leader, the follower can't do
        anything. In fact, the follower's turn is skipped if the leader forgets
        to leave instructions for them.</li> 
        <li>As the follower, follow instructions using your movements and hit
        "done" only once they're achieved. You can't see new instructions until
        you've completed your current instruction.</li>
        <li>The follower's turn ends immediately once you're out of <b>time</b>, <b>moves</b>, or <b>instructions</b>.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Advice</h2>
        <p>This game is structured to reward cooperation. The leader can see the
        entire board, but can only move 5 moves per turn. The follower can move
        twice as far, but the follower's view is clouded with fog and only
        first-person. Cooperate to get a higher score!</p>
